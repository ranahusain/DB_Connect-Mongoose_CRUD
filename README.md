## Concepts

### Schema

A **schema** defines the structure of your documents â€” it is basically a blueprint of your data.

### Model

A **model** is created using a schema and is used to interact with the database (e.g., performing queries).

### CRUD Operations

We perform CRUD operations using model methods like:

- `.find()`
- `.findById()`
- `.findByIdAndDelete()`
- `.save()`, etc.
